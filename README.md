# Customer Management API (DRF)

This project is a backend REST API built using **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**.  
It is created as part of my learning journey with DRF while working on a real-world
customer-based project.

The goal of this project is to understand how backend systems work in practice,
including API design, database interaction, authentication, and data validation.
